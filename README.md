# aimmo-unity

This is the Unity3D prototype for the [AI:MMO project](https://github.com/ocadotechnology/aimmo). 

To apply changes and see them working, first switch to the `unity` branch in the main AI:MMO repository. Then, build the unity project and copy the `Development` and `TemplateData` directories to `aimmo/players/static/unity`. Finally, execute AI:MMO as explained in their README.
